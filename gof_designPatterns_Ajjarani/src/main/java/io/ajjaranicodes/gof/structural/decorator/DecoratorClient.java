 * <b>Decorator Pattern</b>
 * Add or remove additional functionalities or responsibilities from 
 * the object dynamically without impacting the original object.
 * 
 * At times it is required when addition of functionalities is not 
 * possible by sub classing as it might create loads of subclasses.
 * 
 * This pattern is useful when we donâ€™t want to use inheritance 
 * and rather use composition.
