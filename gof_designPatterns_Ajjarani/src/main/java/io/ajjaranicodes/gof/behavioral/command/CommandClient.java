/**
 * <p>4 Terms are associated with Command pattern <em>Command,
 * <em>Receiver, <em> Invoker and <em>Client
 * 
 * <p>A command object knows about the receiver and invokes a method 
 * of the receiver. Values for the parameters of the receiver method
 * are stored in command. The receiver then does the work. An invoker
 * object knows how to execute a command and optionally does book 
 * keeping about the execution. The invoker knows only about the 
 * command interface, thus implementing loose coupling between 
 * receiver and invoker<br>
 * 
 * <b>Definition from GoF</b> 
 * 		Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you 
 * parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, 
 * and support undoable operations
 * 
 * Command pattern uses
 * <li>A history of request is needed
 * <li>Requests need to be handled at variant times or in variant orders
 * <li>The invoker should be decoupled from the object handling invocation
 * 
 * JDK Example - Runnable interface uses Command pattern
